<p>Combining the powerful, feature-rich IdentityServer3 from Thinktecture and the leading Graph database means your users become a native part of your application graph. IdentityServer3 ensures security to modern standards and flexibility while Neo4J means your data closely reflects your domain, and its rich relational capabilities allow you to derive incredible intelligence from your data.</p>

            <a id="why--identityserver3neo4j" class="anchor" href="#why--identityserver3neo4j" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why?
        </h1>

        <p>When building applications backed by a Graph database it became obvious that we needed some representation of the user in the graph for various reasons. Rather than duplicate the data in a separate identity/membership system we decided to combine the two.</p>

        <h1>
            <a id="how--identityserver3neo4j" class="anchor" href="#how--identityserver3neo4j" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How?
        </h1>

        <p>We've tried to make it as easy as possible to bring Neo4j into your IdentityServer3 implementation, or vice-versa, bring identity data into your Neo4j graph.</p>

        <p>First, <a href="https://identityserver.github.io/Documentation/docsv2/overview/simplestOAuth.html">set up IdentityServer3</a> in your project. Brock Allen and Dominick Baier have done a great job with the documentation.</p>

        <p>Then update the app.useIdentityServer() method to use the Neo4j factory instead of the default, in-memory one:</p>

        <pre>app.Map("/identity", idsrvApp =>
{
    idsrvApp.UseIdentityServer(new IdentityServerOptions
    {
        SiteName = "Your site",
        SigningCertificate = LoadCertificate(),
			
    	// Reference the Neo4j version of the services factory
        <b>Factory = Neo4jServiceFactory.Create()</b>
    });
});</pre>

        <p>It's as simple as that.</p>

        <h1>Got any samples?</h1>

        <p>Sure, once you have IdentityServer3 backed by Neo4j the first question we asked ourselves was 'how do I get users into the system?'. 
        The <a href="http://github.com/edgecastle/identityserver3neo4j/" target="_blank">source code on Github</a> includes an OWIN ASP.NET MVC application 
        which includes examples how to drive the Graph services for users, clients, claims and scopes to persist identity and authorization data.</p>

        <h1>Is there a roadmap? How actively developed will this be?</h1>

        <p>Here at <a href="http://www.edgecastle.com/" target="_blank">Edgecastle</a> we're betting big on Graph technologies, with Neo4j being a particular 
        favourite. IdentityServer3Neo4j is a cut of our internal code (properly santized of course) ready for public consumption. We are <b>actively</b> incubating and developing commercial 
        products built on top of IdentityServer3Neo4j and will continue to release cuts of our internal code as we introduce new features that
        we feel will provide value to the community.</p>

        <p>With the library's evolution being linked to various undisclosed products' development we are unable to publish a roadmap, however, we will
        consider all pull requests based on their individual merits and (where possible) without prejudice from the internal roadmap.</p>
